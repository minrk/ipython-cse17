this day doubtful whether he or L. B. Alberti was

should have meant this work by the words _il libro_,

[Footnote: I. _Guiliano Gondi_. Ser Piero da Vinci,
Leonardo's father, lived till 1480, in a house belonging
to Giuliano Gondi. In 1498 this was pulled
down to make room for the fine Palazzo built on
the Piazza San Firenze by Giuliano di San Gallo,
which still exists. In the _Riassunto del Catasto di Ser
Piero da Vinci_, 1480, Leonardo is not mentioned; it
is evident therefore that he was living elsewhere. It
may be noticed incidentally that in the _Catasto di
Giuliano Gondi_ of the same year the following mention
is made of his four eldest sons:

_Lionardo mio figliuolo d'eta d'anni 29, non fa nulla,
Giovambatista d'eta d'anni 28 in Ghostantinopoli,
Billichozo d'eta d'anni 24 a Napoli,
Simone d'eta d'anni 23 in Ungheria.

He himself was a merchant of gold filigree (_facciamo
lavorare una bottegha d'arte di seta ... facciamo
un pocho di trafico a Napoli_}, As he was 59 years
old in 1480, he certainly would not have been alive
at the time of Leonardo's death. But Leonardo must
have been on intimate terms with the family till the
end of his life, for in a letter dated June 1. 1519,
in which Fr. Melzi, writing from Amboise, announces
Leonardo's death to Giuliano da Vinci at Florence
(see p. 284), he says at the end "_Datemene risposta per
i Gondi_" (see UZIELLI, _Ricerche_, passim).

Most of the other names on the list are those
of well-known Florentine families.]

Paolo of Tavechia, to see the marks in

[Footnote: This note occurs on a pen and ink drawing
made by Leonardo as a sketch for the celebrated
large cartoon in the possession of the Royal Academy
of Arts, in London. This cartoon is commonly
supposed to be identical with that described
and lauded by Vasari, which was exhibited in Florence
at the time and which now seems to be lost.
Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, in his valuable
paper (read before the Royal Soc. of Literature,
June 28, 1882) "On the St. Anne of Leonardo da
Vinci", has adduced proof that the cartoon now in the
Royal Academy was executed earlier at Milan. The note
here given, which is written on the sheet containing
the study for the said cartoon, has evidently no
reference to the drawing on which it is written
but is obviously of the same date. Though I have
not any opening here for discussing this question of
the cartoon, it seemed to me important to point out
that the character of the writing in this note does
not confirm the opinion hitherto held that the Royal
Academy cartoon was the one described by Vasari,
but, on the contrary, supports the hypothesis put
forward by Mr. Marks.]

Notes on
pupils

1458.

Giacomo came to live with me on St.-Mary
Magdalen's[*1] day, 1490, aged 10 years. The
second day I had two shirts cut out for him,
a pair of hose, and a jerkin, and when I put
aside some money to pay for these things
he stole 4 _lire_
the money out of the purse; and I could never
make him confess, though I was quite certain
of the fact.--Thief, liar, obstinate, glutton.

The day after, I went to sup with Giacomo
Andrea, and the said Giacomo supped
for two and did mischief for four; for he
brake 3 cruets, spilled the wine, and after
this came to sup where I....

Item: on the 7th day of September he
stole a silver point of the value of 22 soldi
from Marco [Footnote 6: _Marco_, probably Leonardo's pupil Marco d'Oggionno;
1470 is supposed to be the date of his
birth and 1540 of his death.

_Che stava con meco._ We may infer from this that

study having perhaps expired.] who was living with me, 4 _lire_
this being of silver; and he took it from his
studio, and when the said Marco had searched
for it a long while he found it hidden
in the said Giacomo's box 4 _lire_.

[Footnote: _Il di della Maddalena._ July 22.]
 Item: on the 26th January following,
I, being in the house of Messer Galeazzo
da San Severino [Footnote 9: Galeazza. See No. 718 note.], was arranging the festival for his jousting,
and certain footmen having undressed to try on some costumes of wild men for the said festival, Giacomo
went to the purse of one of them which lay
on the bed with other clothes, 2 lire 4 S,
and took out such money as was in it.

Item: when I was in the same house,
Maestro Agostino da Pavia gave to me a
Turkish hide to have 2 lire.
a pair of short boots made of it; this
Giacomo stole it of me within a month and
sold it to a cobbler for 20 soldi, with
which money, by his own confession, he
bought anise comfits.

Item: again, on the 2nd April, Giovan
Antonio [Footnote 16:Giovan Antonio, probably Beltraffio, 1467 to 1516.] having left a silver point on a
drawing of his, Giacomo stole it, and this
was of the value of 24 soldi 1 lira 4 S.

The first year-

A cloak, 2 lire,
6 shirts, 4 lire,
3 jerkins, 6 lire,
4 pairs of hose, 7 lire 8 soldi,
1 lined doublet, 5 lire,
24 pairs of shoes, 6 lire 5 soldi,
A cap, l lira,
laces, 1 lira.
[Footnote: Leonardo here gives a detailed account not only of the loss he and others incurred through Giacomo
but of the wild tricks of the youth, and we may
therefore assume that the note was not made merely
as a record for his own use, but as a report to be
forwarded to the lad's father or other responsible
guardian.]

*1465. 2. _Giovan;_ it is not likely that Leonardo
should have called Giovan' Antonio Beltraffio at one
time Giovanni, as in this note and another time Antonio,
as in No. 1464 while in No. 1458 l. 16 we find
_Giovan'Antonio_, and in No. 1436, l.6 _Beltraffio_. Possibly
the Giovanni here spoken of is Leonardo's less
known pupil Giovan Pietrino (see No. 1467, 5).

2. 3. _Francesco de' Melzi_ is often mentioned, see
Nos. 1350.

3. _Salai_. See No. 1519 note.

4. _Lorenzo_. See No. 1351, l. 10 (p. 408). Amoretti
gives the following note in _Mem. Stor. XXIII:_ 1505.
_Martedi-sera a di 14 d'aprile. Venne Lorenzo a stare
con mecho: disse essere d'eta d'anni 17 .. a di 15 del
detto aprile ebbi scudi 25 d'oro dal chamerlingo di Santa
Maria nuova._ This, he asserts is derived from a MS.
marked S, in quarto. This MS. seems to have
vanished and left no trace behind; Amoretti himself
had not seen it, but copied from a selection of
extracts made by Oltrocchi before the Leonardo
MSS. were conveyed to Paris on the responsibility
of the first French Republic. Lorenzo, by this, must
have been born in 1487. The sculptor Lorenzetto
was born in 1490. Amoretti has been led by the
above passage to make the following absurd observations:

_Cotesto Lorenzo, che poi gli fu sempre compagno, almeno
sin che stette in Italia, sarebb' egli Lorenzo Lotto
bergamasco? Sappiamo essere stato questo valente dipintore
uno de' bravi scolari del Vinci_ (?).

_Il Fafoia_, perhaps a nickname. Cesare da Sesto,
Leonardo's pupil, seems to have been in Rome in these
years, as we learn from a drawing by him in the Louvre.

a highly valuable and interesting disquisition on this
passage under the title: Leonardo da Vinci e la sua
Libreria, note di un bibliofilo (Milano 1873. Ed. di soli
75 esemplari; privately printed). In the autumn of
1880 the Marchese d'Adda showed me a considerable mass of additional notes prepared for a second
edition. This, as he then intended, was to come
out after the publication of this work of mine. After
the much regretted death of the elder Marchese, his
son, the Marchese Gioachino d'Adda was so liberal
as to place these MS. materials at my disposal for
the present work, through the kind intervention of
Signor Gustavo Frizzoni. The following passages,
with the initials G. d'A. are prints from the valuable
notes in that publication, the MS. additions I have

in reproducing here the acute and interesting
observations on the contents of most of the rare books
here enumerated.]

****below must belong to previous page's footnotes***
observations that follow refer to events of the previous month 'of last year' (dell' anno passato). Leonardo
cannot therefore have written thus in Florence where
the year was, at that period, calculated as beginning
in the month of March (see Vol. I, No. 4, note 2).
He must then have been in Milan. What is more
important is that we thus learn how to date the
beginning of the year in all the notes written at
Milan. This clears up Uzielli's doubts: A Milano
facevasi cominciar l'anno ab incarnatione, cioe il 25
Marzo e a nativitate, cioe il 25 Decembre. Ci sembra
probabile che Leonardo dovesse prescegliere lo stile che era in uso a Firenze. (Ricerche, p. 84, note.)

The Archimedes belonging to the Bishop
of Padua.

1475-

Archimedes gave the quadrature of a poly-
gonal figure, but not of the circle. Hence
Archimedes never squared any figure with
curved sides. He squared the circle minus
the smallest portion that the intellect can
conceive, that is the smallest point visible.

1476.

If any man could have discovered the
utmost powers of the cannon, in all its
various forms and have given such a secret
to the Romans, with what rapidity would
they have conquered every country and have
vanquished every army, and what reward could
have been great enough for such a service!
Archimedes indeed, although he had greatly
damaged the Romans in the siege of Syra-
cuse, nevertheless did not fail of being offered
great rewards from these very Romans; and
when Syracuse was taken, diligent search was
made for Archimedes; and he being found
dead greater lamentation was made for him
by the Senate and people of Rome than if
they had lost all their army; and they
did not fail to honour him with burial and
with a statue. At their head was Marcus
Marcellus. And after the second destruction
of Syracuse, the sepulchre of Archimedes was
found again by Cato[25], in the ruins of a
temple. So Cato had the temple restored and
the sepulchre he so highly honoured....
Whence it is written that Cato said that he
was not so proud of any thing he had done
as of having paid such honour to Archimedes.

1474. See No. 1421, 1. 3, 6 and Vol. I, No. 343.

1476. Where Leonardo found the statement that
Cato had found and restored the tomb of Archi-
medes, I do not know. It is a merit that Cicero
claims as his own (Tusc. V, 23) and certainly with
a full right to it. None of Archimedes' biographers
-not even the diligent Mazzucchelli, mentions any
version in which Cato is named. It is evidently a

slip of the memory on Leonardo's part. Besides,
according to the passage in Cicero, the grave was
not found 'nelle mine ffun tempio'-which is highly
improbable as relating to a Greek-but in an open
spot (H. MULLER-STROBING).--See too, as to Archi-
medes, No. 1417.

CORNELIUS CELSUS.

The highest good is wisdom, the chief
evil is suffering in the body. Because, as
we are composed of two things, that is soul
and body, of which the first is the better,
the body is the inferior; wisdom belongs
to the better part, and the chief evil belongs
to the worse part and is the worst of all.
As the best thing of all in the soul is
wisdom, so the worst in the body is suf-
fering. Therefore just as bodily pain is the
chief evil, wisdom is the chief good of the
soul, that is with the wise man; and nothing
else can be compared with it.
[Footnote: Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a Roman physician,
known as the Roman Hippocrates, probably contemporary with Augustus. Only his eight Books 'De
Medicina", are preserved. The earliest editions are:

5th Book of Euclid. First definition: a
part is a quantity of less magnitude than
the greater magnitude when the less is
contained a certain number of times in the
greater.

A part properly speaking is that which
may be multiplied, that is when, being
multiplied by a certain number, it forms exactly
the whole. A common aggregate part ...

Second definition. A greater magnitude is
said to be a multiple of a less, when the
greater is measured by the less.

By the first we define the lesser [magnitude]
and by the second the greater is defined.

Hippocrates says that the origin of men's

limbs transmit their substance to this sperm

channels through which they might come to
the sperm.

I have found in a history of the Spaniards
that in their wars with the English Archimedes
of Syracuse who at that time was living
at the court of Ecliderides, King of the
Cirodastri. And in maritime warfare he ordered that
the ships should have tall masts, and that on
their tops there should be a spar fixed [Footnote 6: Compare No. 1115.] of
40 feet long and one third of a foot thick. At
one end of this was a small grappling iron and
at the other a counterpoise; and there was also
attached 12 feet of chain; and, at the end of
this chain, as much rope as would reach from
the chain to the base of the top, where it was
fixed with a small rope; from this base it ran
down to the bottom of the mast where a
very strong spar was attached and to this
was fastened the end of the rope. But to go on
to the use of his machine; I say that below
this grappling iron was a fire [Footnote 14: Compare No. 1128.] which, with
tremendous noise, threw down its rays and
a shower of burning pitch; which, pouring
down on the [enemy's] top, compelled the
men who were in it to abandon the top
to which the grappling-iron had clung. This
was hooked on to the edges of the top
and then suddenly the cord attached at the
base of the top to support the cord which
went from the grappling iron, was cut, giving
way and drawing in the enemy's ship; and
if the anchor--was cast ...
[Footnote: Archimedes never visited Spain, and the
names here mentioned cannot be explained. Leonardo
seems to quote here from a book, perhaps by some
questionable mediaeval writer. Prof. C. Justi writes to
me from Madrid, that Spanish savants have no knowledge
of the sources from which this story may have
been derived.]

Vitruvius says that small models are of
no avail for ascertaining the effects of large
ones; and I here propose to prove that
this conclusion is a false one. And chiefly
by bringing forward the very same argument
which led him to this conclusion; that is, by
an experiment with an auger. For he proves
that if a man, by a certain exertion of
strength, makes a hole of a given diameter,
and afterwards another hole of double the
diameter, this cannot be made with only
double the exertion of the man's strength,
but needs much more. To this it may very
well be answered that an auger

of double the diameter cannot be
moved by double the exertion, be-
cause the superficies of a body of
the same form but twice as large has
four times the extent of the superficies
of the smaller, as is shown in the two
figures a and n.

OF SQUARING THE CIRCLE, AND WHO IT WAS
THAT FIRST DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT.

Vitruvius, measuring miles by means of
the repeated revolutions of the wheels which
move vehicles, extended over many Stadia
the lines of the circumferences of the circles
of these wheels. He became aware of them
by the animals that moved the vehicles. But
he did not discern that this was a means of
finding a square equal to a circle. This was
first done by Archimedes of Syracuse, who
by multiplying the second diameter of a circle
by half its circumference produced a rectangular
quadrilateral equal figure to the circle.

he wanted for a pair of rose-coloured
hose with their trimming; and there remain
9 ducats due to him-excepting that he owes

[Footnote: With regard to Vante or Attavante, the miniature
painter (not Nanni as I formerly deciphered
this name, which is difficult to read; see _Zeitschrift
fur Bild. Kunst_, 1879, p. 155), and Vasari, Lives of Frate
Giovanni da Fiesole, of Bartolommeo della Gatta,
and of Gherardo, _miniatore._ He, like Leonardo, was
one of the committee of artists who, in 1503, considered
the erection and placing of Michel Angelo's David.
The date of his death is not known; he was of the
same age as Leonardo. Further details will be found
in '_Notizie di Attavante miniatore, e di alcuni suoi lavori_'

*7. _Al fattore._ Il Fattore, was, as is well known,
the nick-name of Giovanni Franceso Penni, born in
Florence in 1486, and subsequently a pupil of Raphael's.
According to Vasari he was known by it
even as a boy. Whether he is spoken of in this
passage, or whether the word Fattore should be translated
literally, I will not undertake to decide. The
latter seems to me more probably right.

[Footnote: The meaning of this document, which is
very difficult to decipher, and is written in
unintelligible
Latin, is, that Leonardo di Mansuetis recommends
the Rev. Mair of Nusdorf, chaplain at Vienna,
to some third person; and says also that something,
which had to be proved, has been proved. The rest
of the passages on the same leaf are undoubtedly
in Leonardo's hand. (Nos. 483, 661, 519, 578, 392,
582, 887 and 894.)]

Johannes Antonius di Johannes Ambro-
sius de Bolate. He who lets time pass and
does not grow in virtue, the more I think
of it the more I grieve. No man has it in
him to be virtuous who will give up honour
for gain. Good fortune is valueless to him
who knows not toil. The man becomes
happy who follows Christ. There is no perfect
gift without great suffering. Our glories
and our triumphs pass away. Foul lust, and
dreams, and luxury, and sloth have banished
every virtue from the world; so that our
Nature, wandering and perplexed, has almost
lost the old and better track. Henceforth it
were well to rouse thyself from sleep. The
master said that lying in down will not bring
thee to Fame; nor staying beneath the quilts.
He who, without Fame, burns his life to waste,
leaves no more vestige of himself on earth than
wind-blown smoke, or the foam upon the sea.
[Footnote: From the last sentence we may infer that
this text is by the hand of a pupil of Leonardo's.--
On the same sheet are the notes Nos.1175 and 715
in Leonardo's own handwriting.]

[Footnote: AMORETTI, Mem. Stor. XXIV, quotes the first
three lines of this letter as by Leonardo. The
cha-
racter of the writing however does not favour this
hypothesis, and still less the contents. I should
regard it rather a rough draft of a letter by young
Melzi. I have not succeeded in deciphering
completely
the 13 lines of this text. Amoretti reads at
the beginning Canonica di Vaprio, but Vaprio seems
to me a very doubtful reading.]

[Footnote 1560: These three epigrams on the portrait of
Lucrezia Crivelli, a picture by Leonardo which must
have been lost at a very early date, seem to have
been dedicated to Leonardo by the poet. Leonardo
used the reverse of the sheet for notes on geometry.]

and in 1505 at Lyons.].

[Footnote 2:2. This text appears to be in a handwriting different
from that in the note, l. 1. Here the reading is
not so simple as AMORETTI gave it, _Mem. Star. XXV:
A Monsieur Lyonard Peintre du Roy pour Amboyse_. He
says too that this address is of the year 1509, and
Mr. Ravaisson remarks: "_De cette suscription il semble
qu'on peut inferer que Leonard etait alors en France, a
la cour de Louis XII ... Pour conclure je crois qu'il
n'est pas prouve que Leonard de Vinci n'ait pas fait un
voyage de quelques mois en France sous Louis XII, entre
le printemps de 1509 et l'automne de 1510_."--I must
confess that I myself have not succeeded in deciphering
completely this French writing of which two
words remain to me doubtful. But so much seems to
be quite evident that this is not an address of a letter
at all, but a certificate or note. _Amboise_[l. 6] I believe
to be the signature of Charles d'Amboise the
Governor of Milan. If this explanation is the right
one, it can be easily explained by the contents of
Nos. 1350 and 1529. The note, line 1, was perhaps
added later by another hand; and Leonardo himself
wrote afterwards on the same sheet some geometrical
explanations. I must also point out that the
statement that this sheet belongs to the year 1509
has absolutely no foundation in fact. There is no
clue whatever for giving a precise date to this note.]

Leonardo's
Will.

Be it known to all persons, present and
to come that at the court of our Lord the
King at Amboise before ourselves in person,
Messer Leonardo da Vinci painter
to the King, at present staying at the place
known as Cloux near Amboise, duly considering
the certainty of death and the uncertainty
of its time, has acknowledged and
declared in the said court and before us that
he has made, according to the tenor of these
presents, his testament and the declaration of
his last will, as follows. And first he commends
his soul to our Lord, Almighty God,
and to the Glorious Virgin Mary, and to our
lord Saint Michael, to all the blessed Angels
and Saints male and female in Paradise.

Item. The said Testator desires to be
buried within the church of Saint Florentin
at Amboise, and that his body shall be borne
thither by the chaplains of the church.

Item. That his body may be followed
from the said place to the said church of
Saint Florentin by the _collegium_ of the said
church, that is to say by the rector and the
prior, or by their vicars and chaplains of the
church of Saint Denis of Amboise, also the
lesser friars of the place, and before his body
shall be carried to the said church this Testator
desires, that in the said church of Saint
Florentin three grand masses shall be celebrated
by the deacon and sub-deacon and
that on the day when these three high masses
are celebrated, thirty low masses shall also
be performed at Saint Gregoire.

Item. That in the said church of Saint
Denis similar services shall be performed, as
above.

Item. That the same shall be done in
the church of the said friars and lesser
brethren.

Item. The aforesaid Testator gives and
bequeaths to Messer Francesco da Melzo,
nobleman, of Milan, in remuneration for services
and favours done to him in the past, each

[Footnote: See page 420.]
 and all of the books the Testator is at present
possessed of, and the instruments and
portraits appertaining to his art and calling
as a painter.

Item. The same Testator gives and bequeaths
henceforth for ever to Battista de Vilanis
his servant one half, that is the moity, of his
garden which is outside the walls of Milan,
and the other half of the same garden to
Salai his servant; in which garden aforesaid
Salai has built and constructed a house which
shall be and remain henceforth in all perpetuity
the property of the said Salai, his
heirs and successors; and this is in remuneration
for the good and kind services which
the said de Vilanis and Salai, his servants
have done him in past times until now.

Item. The said Testator gives to Maturina
his waiting woman a cloak of good
black cloth lined with fur, a..... of cloth
and two ducats paid once only; and this
likewise is in remuneration for good service
rendered to him in past times by the said
Maturina.

Item. He desires that at his funeral
sixty tapers shall be carried which shall be
borne by sixty poor men, to whom shall be given
money for carrying them; at the discretion
of the said Melzo, and these tapers shall be
distributed among the four above mentioned
churches.

Item. The said Testator gives to each
of the said churches ten lbs. of wax in thick
tapers, which shall be placed in the said
churches to be used on the day when those
said services are celebrated.

Item. That alms shall be given to the
poor of the Hotel-Dieu, to the poor of Saint
Lazare d'Amboise and, to that end, there
shall be given and paid to the treasurers of
that same fraternity the sum and amount of
seventy soldi of Tours.

Item. The said Testator gives and bequeaths
to the said Messer Francesco Melzo,
being present and agreeing, the remainder of
his pension and the sums of money which
are owing to him from the past time till
the day of his death by the receiver or
treasurer-general M. Johan Sapin, and
each and every sum of money that he has
already received from the aforesaid Sapin
of his said pension, and in case he should
die before the said Melzo and not otherwise;
which moneys are at present in the possession
of the said Testator in the said place
called Cloux, as he says. And he likewise
gives and bequeaths to the said Melzo all and
each of his clothes which he at present possesses
at the said place of Cloux, and all in
 remuneration for the good and kind services
done by him in past times till now, as well as
in payment for the trouble and annoyance he
may incur with regard to the execution of this
present testament, which however, shall all
be at the expense of the said Testator.

And he orders and desires that the sum
of four hundred scudi del Sole, which he
has deposited in the hands of the treasurer
of Santa Maria Nuova in the city of Florence,
may be given to his brothers now living in Florence
with all the interest and usufruct that
may have accrued up to the present time, and
be due from the aforesaid treasurer to the aforesaid
Testator on account of the said four hundred
crowns, since they were given and consigned
by the Testator to the said treasurers.

Item. He desires and orders that the
said Messer Francesco de Melzo shall be
and remain the sole and only executor of
the said will of the said Testator; and that the
said testament shall be executed in its full and
complete meaning and according to that which
is here narrated and said, to have, hold, keep
and observe, the said Messer Leonardo da Vinci,
constituted Testator, has obliged and obliges by
these presents the said his heirs and successors
with all his goods moveable and immoveable
present and to come, and has renounced and
expressly renounces by these presents all and
each of the things which to that are contrary.
Given at the said place of Cloux in the
presence of Magister Spirito Fieri vicar, of
the church of Saint Denis at Amboise, of
M. Guglielmo Croysant priest and chaplain,
of Magister Cipriane Fulchin, Brother Francesco
de Corion, and of Francesco da Milano,
a brother of the Convent of the Minorites
at Amboise, witnesses summoned and required
to that end by the indictment of the
said court in the presence of the aforesaid
M. Francesco de Melze who accepting and
agreeing to the same has promised by his
faith and his oath which he has administered
to us personally and has sworn to us never
to do nor say nor act in any way to the contrary.
And it is sealed by his request with
the royal seal apposed to legal contracts at
Amboise, and in token of good faith.

Given on the XXIIIrd day of April
MDXVIII, before Easter.

And on the XXIIIrd day of this month of
April MDXVIII, in the presence of M. Guglielmo
Borian, Royal notary in the court
of the bailiwick of Amboise, the aforesaid
M. Leonardo de Vinci gave and bequeathed,
by his last will and testament, as aforesaid,
to the said M. Baptista de Vilanis, being
present and agreeing, the right of water which
 the King Louis XII, of pious memory lately
deceased gave to this same de Vinci, the
stream of the canal of Santo Cristoforo in
the duchy of Milan, to belong to the said
Vilanis for ever in such wise and manner
that the said gentleman made him this gift
in the presence of M. Francesco da Melzo,
gentleman, of Milan and in mine.

And on the aforesaid day in the said
month of April in the said year MDXVIII
the same M. Leonardo de Vinci by his last
will and testament gave to the aforesaid

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is

          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
